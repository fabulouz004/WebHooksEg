Hi Joseph

You want to create a repo or use a existing repo 
in github?

you can use an existing one

Show me 



ok
It is not uploading in existing one
So I'm going to create a new one. This is what I'm doing now. Enter project name that is going to uploaded in the github

Ok?
i understand

You want this code/project in public or private?

can you access it if its in private ?

Yeah, You can add me as a collabrator.

let's go private then

Normally git is a version managemnt tool
Github is a social site or it contains all the repositories(our files)

We can push our code github in two ways.

One by cli(Command line interface)
Other one is gui(graphical user interface)

Github Desktop is a gui

But programmers must learn cli as well


Enter your pass in the github






We can close this once after I tell you the below things. Ok?

yes sir


Last one I want to tell you.

That is autodeploment in the live server.

I will show you how.

I am going to create a repo and it is going to automatically uploaded to the cpanel.

OK?

check your whatsapp

let me show you it works now

would still love you to show me the autodeploment process

Yeah I saw it.
